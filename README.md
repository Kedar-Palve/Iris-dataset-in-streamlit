# Iris-dataset-in-streamlit

This is a simple Python project that uses the Streamlit library to create a web-based dashboard for detecting the species of flowers in the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic example in machine learning, and it contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 different iris flowers.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build an interactive web application using the Streamlit library. With this dashboard, users can upload their own CSV files containing measurements of iris flowers, and the dashboard will use a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the species of each flower.

To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

This will launch the Streamlit app, and you can start exploring the Iris dataset and making predictions about the species of different flowers. The project is fully open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to use and modify.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
